Work and Research Experience
======
### Dartmouth College, EDIT Lab
Graduate Research Assistant, Nov. 2021 - Present
* Participated in NLP group, comparing performances of different Deep Learning models on medical text data with Huggingface transformer
* Organized tutorial documentation for specific used medical text dataset

### DeepWisdom, Research Department
Research Internship, Oct. 2020 – Jan. 2021
* Participated in the design of a new generation of feature search framework, using Monte Carlo tree search combined with a genetic algorithm; improved the new feature search process, and greatly reduced the search space and time complexity
* Learned the code of Autoseries, a machine learning framework independently developed by the company, and compared the scores of Autoseries and a variety of mainstream machine learning models for stock time series forecasting
* Responsible for a company named Rookie's dynamic price adjustment strategy; used greedy algorithms, Bayesian optimization and recursive strategies to implement price simulation mechanisms and build a basic simulation model, while also promoting Deep Wisdom’s successful cooperation with Rookie
* Organized tutorial reference documents for the Deep Learning and AutoML used

### Netease, Youdao Dictionary Overseas Edition
Data Scientist Intern, Jun. 2020 – Oct. 2020
* Used NLP and logistic regression, Bayesian and other methods to perform text sentiment analysis on user review text data
* Combined results from the text sentiment analysis with product version update information to calculate text semantic similarity and analyze the actual effect of version update; used Tableau to visualize the results
* Crawled past cover image data and accessed Baidu image and text recognition API to combine the click data and train the model to construct the cover image scoring prediction mechanism
* Regularly analyzed push articles by topic text, country, language, and time. Made weekly data report production fully automated with automated SQL database crawling and data cleaning, reducing the production time from 4-5 hours to 5 minutes, greatly improving work efficiency

### Baidu, Business-to-Business (B2B)
Data Analysis Intern, Feb. 2020 – May 2020
*	Participated in the process design of Baidu search for B2B related products; conducted product-related research and data analysis; completed the product scheme design and product cycle iteration in the B2B search scenario
*	Designed selenium crawler scripts through Python, and worked with the team to overcome the anti-crawling measures using nearly 100,000 high-quality crawling data points
